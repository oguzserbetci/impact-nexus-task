While cooking the pasta, combine all other ingredients in a food processor and pulse. The pesto is finished when all ingredients are processed but not too creamy, as the consistency should still have a little bit of texture. When the pasta is al dente, strain and mix in the pesto. Garnish with some basil leaves and extra Parmesan. Tip To prevent the pesto from oxidising (browning), blanche the leaves before use. Place the basil leaves in boiling water for 30 seconds and then quickly pop them into a bowl of ice water. Gently dry them and proceeding with the recipe.
