Established in 1984, St Benedict\u2019s Hospice provides specialist palliative care to the people of Sunderland and surrounding districts. Providing a range of services across the whole community including day services, out-patients, care in the home, hospital or care home as well as in-patient beds, they have achieved Centre of Excellence status. As the only dedicated hospice to serve the City of Sunderland, it\u2019s estimated that at any one time, they have approximately 300 patients using their services. After an extensive process of shortlisting a number of regional charities, Hyperdrive selected St Benedict\u2019s Hospice in a company wide employee vote. The Hyperdrive team will take part in a calendar of fundraising activities throughout 2020 including sky diving, sporting events, bake off\u2019s, dress down days and ongoing activities to fully support their new charity partner. Chris Pennison, CEO at Hyperdrive commented , \u201cSt Benedict\u2019s Hospice is a fantastic charity that serves the community in which our team live and work. We were overwhelmed to learn that 1 in 3 people in our region will at some stage in their life require hospice care. On behalf of the Board, I\u2019m inspired by the level of enthusiasm displayed by our team to support those living with an incurable illness and confident our partnership will be a success.\u201d Anthony McDermott, Head of Corporate Relationships, Challenge Events and Digital Communications at St Benedict\u2019s Hospice commented , \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Hyperdrive Innovation as the latest corporate supporter to pledge their allegiance to St Benedict\u2019s Hospice across the next 12 months. In a challenging and at times competitive fundraising market, it\u2019s imperative that we have the support of locally based businesses to help us achieve our aims. Having personally followed the success of Hyperdrive Innovation in recent years, it\u2019s a true honour to have them on board and we\u2019re looking forward to the year ahead\u201d The partnership will officially begin on 1st March 2020 and will last 12 months.

The legislative net has been tightening around the automotive industry\u2019s emissions standards for many years now \u2013 and it\u2019s been well publicised. We\u2019re all now very familiar with the concept of the London congestion charge and catalytic converters on our diesel cars. However, one sector that\u2019s so avoided the lime light is NRMM \u2013 everything from agricultural machinery, construction, building material machinery, industrial trucks, cranes and even inland waterway vessels. Now, just like the auto industry, NRMM is undergoing a profound change, driven by legislation. What are EU Stage 5 Regulations? As of 1 January 2019, all new machines which fall within the scope of NRMM have had to comply with new emissions standards; Euro-Stage 5. This means that for the first time, all engines with a power range up to 560 kW are included in EU emissions legislation. The purpose? To further reduce the levels of particulate matter (PM) produced by internal combustion engines (ICE). So, weather someone is working in a warehouse that uses diesel forklifts, ploughing the fields in a tractor or simply walking past a construction site using ICE excavators and generators, the air they breathe should be much cleaner as a result. For those using ICE engines, there\u2019s no getting around the fact you will have to comply. All combustion engines, whether they\u2019re petrol, diesel, gas, or anything else are included, and it applies equally to both variable-speed and constant-speed engines. Are you ready for EU Stage 5 Regulations? Euro Stage 5 engine regulations are injecting urgency into the vast number of industries using NRMM. They are keen to not just comply with current regulations but also get ahead of the curve and protect their businesses against future, tougher regulations. Traditional OEMs, factory managers, construction companies and virtually every other sector that requires powertrains, are now, therefore, embroiled in a race. A race to slash emissions. A race to electrify. This may sound like a daunting task \u2013 especially at a time of ever tightening budgets, when R&D into new and effective drive chains can come at large expense. However, without electrifying, these businesses could face the prospect of installing expensive engine after-treatment to comply. In some cases, this could add 50-100% to the cost of machinery. With you at every stage That\u2019s where we can help. By offering a spade-ready, bespoke and affordable alternative that\u2019s zero emissions, future proof and trusted by household brands, we can be your electrification partner to navigate you through the rapidly changing legislative landscape. Not only does this save many years and potentially huge sums of money on inhouse R&D, but by making the speedy transition to electrification, you can begin to see other savings such as lowered maintenance and fuel costs almost immediately. Not only that, going electric has multiple benefits for your customers, from improved operator comfort, reduced noise pollution, and enabling 24/7 operations in city centres, residential areas, near schools and hospitals with zero disruption.

Utilising industry leading lithium-ion battery technology means the Speed Levels will deliver extended duty cycles for longer, continuous operation. Lithium-ion batteries are also shown to last up to 20 times longer than lead acid batteries. The use of maintenance free lithium-ion battery packs reduces running costs by up to 95% when compared to the combustion engine alternative. They also deliver increased operator comfort with significantly less noise, making the new SL26RTE and SL30RTE 60% quieter than the existing Snorkel SL26SL \u2013 which is already an industry leader. The low voltage system is also easily serviced, without the need for specialist high voltage training, and has been tested in climatic chambers between -25\u00b0C and +60\u00b0C. This bold partnership comes as Hyperdrive prepares to triple UK manufacturing capability in response to significant national and international growth. Stephen Irish, Commercial Director at Hyperdrive commented, \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic to partner with Snorkel on their first lithium-ion battery powered machine. To have the opportunity to collaborate with another progressive and forward-thinking business that is at the forefront of their industry is testament to our capabilities and a great example of the wave of clean growth being driven by changing legislation internationally.\u201d We are delighted to secure the contract to supply the SL26RTE and SL30RTE with the very latest Hyperdrive battery technology and working to a demanding timeline, it has been a pleasure to support Snorkel to take the initial concept vehicle through its development cycle and into production.\u201d John Gill, Chief Manufacturing Officer at Snorkel commented, \u201cWe are pleased to have signed an official supply agreement with Hyperdrive Innovation, with whom Snorkel has worked closely with to develop a stable electric powerchain that can deliver the reliability and performance that our customers require. Following very positive feedback to our preview at Bauma, the design has undergone thorough testing, both in concept and in field evaluations, and we are confident that these models will exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.\u201d Contact us Do you want to know more about our battery energy storage solutions?

Battery technology will play a vital role in powering the cars and storing the energy, that for example, wind turbines or solar panels produce. More and more homes and buildings will be upgraded to incorporate energy storage facilities. The battery industry has to respond to this demand. More research and development is required to reach the increased requirements for a greater range for electric vehicles, or the ability to produce cells cheaper to reduce costs. To deliver this, battery technology firms which are at the forefront of innovation need continued access to capital. More importantly, patient capital which understands that while the revolution is underway, until the technology scales and consumer and business demand peaks, returns maybe some time away. The potential, however, is enormous. The UK is one of the world leaders in battery technology, and it is vital that it remains at the forefront in the face of considerable global competition. The north east is already a world-class hub with car manufacturers like Nissan working closely with local universities and businesses, like Hyperdrive Innovation to develop the latest in battery technology. We have received support from Government agencies like Innovate UK and the Advanced Propulsion Centre and recently set up a manufacturing partnership in Asia to help meet the demand for our technology. We are ambitious to do more, but the competition is fierce. Around the world, governments are pouring funds into the industry. For example, Australia\u2019s Government is investing more than $200 million. In the UK, the Government set up the Faraday Challenge \u2013 a \u00a3246 million commitment until 2021 for battery development. The Faraday Challenge has been very successful, and Hyperdrive has benefitted from funding for some projects. However, it backs only a finite number of projects and is time-limited. One of the frustrations from an SME perspective is that the application process can prove very time consuming, a constraint on available resources and at times, expensive. Government funding is one thing, but there also needs to be private sources of capital. When you consider that China has a battery manufacturer, CLS, worth more than \u00a311.5 billion, than the scale of the competition is evident. Recently Gore Street Energy Storage, an investment company striving to be the UK\u2019s first listed \u2018battery\u2019 fund, cut its fund-raising target to \u00a335 million from \u00a3100 million. Restrained Government funding makes private sources more critical. For the UK to remain competitive, we need to look at ensuring that the industry can rely on long-term sources of funding. It would be great to understand what the Government\u2019s plans for the sector are, especially post-Brexit and are there ways, perhaps through the tax system to encourage more private capital into the industry? Britain is a world leader in battery technology, and there is an opportunity for businesses to scale to become global players. It is essential that companies, governments and investors plan and work together to make sure we continue to compete on the world stage.

Involved in a variety of projects including battery production improvements, IP testing and supply chain research, we caught up with him to learn more about his expected industry trends and ambitious plans for the future. What drew you to Engineering? Early years at school were essential for sparking my interest in Engineering. Much was made of the global issue of climate change and how the onus is on my generation to lead the transition to sustainable energy. Naturally, I was inspired to study engineering as a means of playing my part in this green technology revolution. What industry trends do you expect to see in the next 10 years? The start of this new decade will hopefully be looked back upon in the years to come as an inflection point in the journey to electrification. I expect to see the economic and engineering benefits of an electric motor coupled with lithium-ion batteries lead to accelerated reduction of market dominance of fossil-fuel powered devices in all but a few applications. Advances in power electronics, battery chemistries and manufacturing will make this case ever more compelling. What engineering problem do you hope to solve throughout your career? The problem I am most fascinated by is energy storage, hence I am delighted to be at Hyperdrive learning the fundamentals of battery systems design and manufacturing. There is no one size fits all solution to this problem, and each application has a specific technology that is best suited to it. I hope to contribute towards bringing individual consumers the ability to store their own electricity throughout my career. What are your goals for the next 5 years? My 5 year plan includes returning to University after this placement to complete my Masters in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, followed by a Masters in Carbon Finance. With this skill set I hope to work on engineering projects, with a focus on economical viability. I hope to gain a place in a team as a graduate engineer within the green technology industry, as I work towards Engineering Chartership.
